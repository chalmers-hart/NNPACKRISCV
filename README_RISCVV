Winograd is vectorized for RISC-V Vector and has been extracted from the NNPACK repository. 

Download:
    git clone https://github.com/soniab/NNPACKRISCV.git

Building:
    convolutional_inference.c contains the kernels required for the vectorized Winograd impelmentations for RISC-V Vector. 
    Change the path of the compiler in the Makefile if necessary and run the following command. 
        'make' 
   
Building with EPI-0.7 for RISC-V Vector:
    convolutional_inference0.7.c contains the kernels required for the vectorized Winograd impelmentations for RISC-V Vector which target version 0.7. 
    Change the path of the compiler in the Makefile-0.7 file if necessary and run the following command. 
        'make -f Makefile-0.7'
