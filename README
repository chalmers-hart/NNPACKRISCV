Winograd is vectorized for RISC-V Vector and has been extracted from the NNPACK repository. 

use source compilation.sh to make the static compilation for the Winograd kernels from NNPACK.

steps to make the static library:
step 1: change the path of the compiler in he given command in the executable.sh
~/llvm-EPI-development-toolchain-cross/bin/clang --target=riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu  -mepi  -v -fno-vectorize -fno-slp-vectorize -c convolutional_inference-debug-longvls.c -o lib.o

step 2: source compilation.sh
